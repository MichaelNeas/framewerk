**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. This app is free and open source, and it always will be.  Please feel free to contribute to the application on Github at https://github.com/MichaelNeas/framewerk. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Michael Neas, but feel free to use them as needed.

Michael Neas is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

Along the same lines, Michael Neas cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. any modifications of the cards in Framewerk are completely under your control.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Michael Neas does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
