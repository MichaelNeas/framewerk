#### There are so many frameworks provided by apple today, do you know about them all?

## Motivation

Learn SwiftUI and help discover new Apple frameworks I've never used before

## Data

The transpiled data driving this application is free and open to anyone at `Framewerk/db.json`, give a shout out if you find it useful üòÅ I plan to expand and keep it updated with apple releases.

## Customizable

In a future state, all cards should be fully customizable, you will have the option to remove all cards and make your own deck.
